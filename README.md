This project showcases a complete end-to-end automation setup using [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with TypeScript. It includes both **UI** and **API** testing, following the **Page Object Model** design pattern and best practices for scalable test automation.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ End-to-End UI Testing with Playwright
- 🔌 REST API Testing (Playwright + SuperTest or Fetch)
- 🧱 Page Object Model (POM) structure
- 📤 TypeScript-based codebase
- 🧪 Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- 🐞 Parallel test execution
- 📸 Screenshots & trace viewer for debugging
- 📊 HTML Reports with Playwright Test
- 🔄 CI/CD Ready (GitHub Actions/Jenkins compatible)
